# Perception_distance
This is a test. For a long time, psychological restoration has been an interesting topic (such as how interaction with nature could reduce or alleviate human stress), but one question, the relationship between psychological restoration and perception distance (how far we can see? or how distance we can precept?), is not comprehensive understand. In this study, we proposed a machine learning-based method to explore the relationship between these.
